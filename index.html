                        <h3>Recipe</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking powder. Mix
                                well.</li>
                            <li>Add melted ghee or butter to the dry ingredients and mix until it resembles
                                breadcrumbs.</li>
                            <li>Gradually add milk, a little at a time, and knead to form a smooth dough. The
                                dough should be soft and pliable but not too sticky.</li>
                            <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into smooth balls
                                without any cracks.</li>
                            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. Fry the dough balls in batches
                                until they turn golden brown. Make sure the oil is not too hot; otherwise, the
                                gulab jamuns will remain uncooked from the inside.</li>
                            <li>While the gulab jamuns are frying, prepare the sugar syrup. In a separate pan,
                                combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the sugar completely
                                dissolves and the syrup slightly thickens. Add cardamom powder, saffron strands,
                                and rose water (if using). Remove from heat.</li>
                            <li>Once the gulab jamuns are golden brown, remove them from the oil and drain
                                excess oil on a paper towel.</li>
                            <li>Immediately transfer the hot gulab jamuns to the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak
                                in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours before serving.</li>
                            <li>Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts if desired.</li>

                        <h3>Recipe</h3>
                        <p>
                            Prepare the Dough:

                            In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and oil/ghee.
                            Mix well until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
                            Gradually add water and knead into a firm yet pliable dough.
                            Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.
                            Prepare the Filling:

                            Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds and coriander seeds. Let them splutter.
                            Add chopped onions, green chilies, and grated ginger. Saut√© until onions turn translucent.
                            Add turmeric powder, mashed potatoes, green peas, garam masala powder, dry mango powder (or
                            lemon juice), and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes until the filling is well
                            combined and fragrant.
                            Remove from heat and let the filling cool completely.
                            Assemble the Samosas:

                            Divide the rested dough into small equal-sized balls.
                            Roll out each ball into a thin oval or circular shape, like a small chapati.
                            Cut each rolled-out dough into half to form semi-circles.
                            Shape the Samosas:

                            Take one semi-circle and fold it into a cone shape, sealing the edges with a little water.
                            Fill the cone with the prepared potato filling.
                            Seal the open edges of the cone tightly, ensuring there are no gaps for the filling to leak
                            out during frying. You can crimp the edges for a decorative finish if desired.
                            Fry the Samosas:

                            Heat oil for deep frying in a pan or kadhai over medium heat.
                            Once the oil is hot, gently slide in the prepared samosas, a few at a time.
                            Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides.
                            Remove with a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.
                            Serve:

                            Serve the hot and crispy samosas with your favorite chutney or sauce.
